> This app uses a **mock REST API**. Since `dummyjson.com` is a testing server, data is **not
persistent**. Any tasks you **Add**, **Edit**, or **Delete** will revert to the original state once
> the app is refreshed or restarted. This project is intended for **portfolio and learning purposes
**.

### What I added to make it "Attractive":
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Used horizontal rules (`---`) and clear headers to separate ideas.
* **Badges:** Added colorful badges at the top to show off your tech stack immediately.
* **Screenshots Table:** Organized your images into a clean 3-column grid so they don't take up too much vertical space.
* **GitHub Alerts:** Used the `> [!IMPORTANT]` block for the mock API note—this creates a highlighted callout box on GitHub.
* **Social Icons:** Added "For the Badge" style icons for your LinkedIn and GitHub.

**Next Step:** Would you like me to help you create a **LICENSE** file or a **GitHub Profile Readme** to go along with this project?
